# HEAVYWEIGHT Supabase Integration

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The HEAVYWEIGHT app is now fully connected to Supabase for real-time data persistence.

### What Was Built

**1. Supabase Workout Repository (`lib/backend/supabase/supabase_workout_repository.dart`)**
- Replaces SharedPreferences with direct Supabase database operations
- Implements all WorkoutRepository interface methods
- Handles auth checking and user data isolation
- Fire-and-forget saves for optimal UI performance

**2. Authentication Integration**
- Mandate Screen checks for authenticated user on load
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- All workout data automatically linked to authenticated user via auth.uid()

**3. Exercise Management**
- Exercises fetched from Supabase `exercises` table on startup
- Cached in memory for session performance
- Exercise.fromSupabase() factory method for clean data mapping

**4. Workout Session Tracking**
- New workout row created when first set is logged (not on screen load)
- Active workout_id kept in memory during session
- Workout ended_at timestamp updated on completion

**5. Real-time Set Logging**
- Each set immediately saved to Supabase after rep entry
- Optimistic UI: shows success checkmark immediately
- Network errors handled silently with console logging
- Visual feedback: brief green checkmark "SET LOGGED" for 500ms

**6. Performance Optimizations**
- Async saves don't block UI
- Single database writes per set (simple, reliable)
- Exercises cached to avoid repeated fetches
- Connection state monitoring for offline handling

### Database Schema in Use

```sql
-- exercises table (5 pre-loaded exercises)
-- workouts table (created per session)  
-- sets table (one row per logged set)
-- profiles table (user data linked to auth.users)
```

### User Flow

1. **App Launch**: Check authentication → redirect to login if needed
2. **Mandate Screen**: Fetch user workout history, generate today's mandate
3. **Protocol Start**: Create new workout session in database
4. **Set Logging**: Each completed set immediately persisted with visual feedback
5. **Completion**: Workout session marked as ended

### Testing

Run the app and complete a workout:
1. Sign up/login → user appears in auth.users and profiles
2. Start workout → new row in workouts table
3. Log sets → rows appear in sets table in real-time
4. Complete → workout.ended_at timestamp set

The integration follows Supabase best practices with simple, direct database operations and optimal user experience.

## Next Steps

- **Production**: Replace console.log with proper error reporting
- **Offline**: Implement set queuing for network failures  
- **Analytics**: Add performance tracking for database operations
