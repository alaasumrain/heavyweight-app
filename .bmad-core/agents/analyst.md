## Sample Analysis Output

```markdown
## Feature Analysis: Workout Session Management

### Business Requirement
Users need to execute prescribed workouts with real-time logging and progression tracking.

### Technical Requirements
1. **Session State Management**
   - Current exercise tracking
   - Rep/set counters with validation
   - Rest timer with enforcement
   - Progress persistence

2. **Flutter Implementation**
   - Provider-based state management
   - Timer widgets with background support  
   - Offline-first data storage
   - Real-time sync with Supabase

3. **User Experience**
   - Brutalist design consistency
   - One-tap interactions
   - Enforced rest periods
   - Immediate feedback loops

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can start/pause/complete workout sessions
- [ ] Rep logging accepts 0-30+ values with no validation limits
- [ ] Rest periods are enforced (3+ minutes) with no skip option
- [ ] All data syncs to Supabase with offline support
- [ ] Session state persists through app backgrounding

### Dependencies
- Exercise library with prescribed weights
- User calibration data for load calculation
- Supabase real-time subscriptions for sync
```
