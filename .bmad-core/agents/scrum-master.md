### Flutter-Specific Story Considerations

#### Widget Architecture Stories
```markdown
# Story: Workout Session State Management

## Technical Context
Implement Provider-based state management for workout sessions with the following architecture:

```dart
class WorkoutSessionProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  WorkoutSession? _activeSession;
  Exercise? _currentExercise;
  int _currentSet = 1;
  Timer? _restTimer;
  
  // State accessors
  WorkoutSession? get activeSession => _activeSession;
  Exercise? get currentExercise => _currentExercise;
  bool get isResting => _restTimer?.isActive ?? false;
  
  // State mutations with proper notification
  Future<void> startSession(List<Exercise> exercises) async {
    _activeSession = WorkoutSession.create(exercises);
    _currentExercise = exercises.first;
    notifyListeners();
    
    // Persist state for crash recovery
    await _persistSessionState();
  }
}
```

## Development Notes
- Use ChangeNotifier for state management (not Riverpod or Bloc)
- Implement immediate local persistence on all state changes
- Add Timer management for rest periods with proper cleanup
- Include crash recovery by loading persisted state on app restart
```

#### Data Layer Stories  
```markdown
# Story: Offline-First Workout Data Sync

## Technical Context
Implement repository pattern with offline-first approach:

1. **Local Storage**: SQLite/Hive for immediate data persistence
2. **Remote Sync**: Supabase integration with conflict resolution
3. **Connection Handling**: Automatic sync when connectivity restored
4. **Error Recovery**: Retry logic for failed sync operations

## Development Notes
- Always write to local storage first
- Queue remote operations for background sync
- Use optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- Implement exponential backoff for retry logic
```

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Handoff Process
1. **PM → Scrum Master**: Requirements and priority
2. **Scrum Master → Analyst**: Detailed analysis request  
3. **Analyst → Scrum Master**: Analysis and technical requirements
4. **Scrum Master → Architect**: Architecture and design needs
5. **Architect → Scrum Master**: Technical specifications
6. **Scrum Master → Dev**: Complete development story
7. **Dev → QA**: Implementation for testing
8. **QA → Scrum Master**: Test results and feedback

### Context Transfer Mechanism
Each story file contains complete context including:
- Business requirements from PM
- Technical analysis from Analyst  
- Architectural decisions from Architect
- Implementation guidance for Dev team
- Testing criteria for QA team

### Daily Coordination
```markdown
## Daily Standup Template

### Agent Status Updates
**Analyst**: [Current analysis work, blocking questions]
**Architect**: [Design decisions made, technical challenges]  
**Dev**: [Features completed, current work, blockers]
**QA**: [Testing progress, bugs found, release readiness]
**Scrum Master**: [Sprint progress, impediment removal, next priorities]

### Sprint Metrics
